TELEGRAM BOT


Telegram Bot is a service that integrates the proposed infrastructure into the Telegram
platform, a cloud-based instant messaging infrastructure. 
It retrieves measurements from IoT devices exploiting REST Web Services provided by the Raspberry Pi and Other
Device Connectors and historical data from the Thingspeak Adaptor. 

It also allows users to send actuation commands to our IoT devices as wished, 
as a MQTT publisher. --> area1/actuation/pump and area1/actuation/air


It acts as aMQTT subscriber, to show alerts.--> area1/motion/alert
